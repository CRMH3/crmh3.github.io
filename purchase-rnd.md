# Purchase (R&D)

## Request for quote

> If the item is exclusively distributed by a supplier, you need to obtain a proof of sole distributor from the supplier ([example here](/files/proof-of-solo-distributor.pdf)). In this case, only one quotation is needed.

- Below HKD 50,000: at least 2 quotations
- HKD 50,000 - 1,400,000: at least 5 quotations (notify lab manager before upload)
- Above HKD 1,400,000: open tender (notify PI and lab manager before upload)

## Generating PO (before placing order)

>  If the supplier is not yet registered in the KingDee system, you need to ask the supplier to fill in this form: [中文版](/files/supplier-registration-form-(chi).pdf) / [English version](/files/supplier-registration-form-(eng).pdf). The supplier also need to provide the scanned copy of their BR (business registration). Send them to the lab manager.

2. Create a folder with your name and items to purchase.

10. If your folder disappears from the shared folder, it means it is uploaded to KingDee.
