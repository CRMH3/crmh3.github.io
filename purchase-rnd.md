# Purchase (R&D)

## Request for Quotation

- If the item is exclusively distributed by a supplier, only one quotation is needed. But you need to obtain a proof of sole distributor from the supplier ([example here](/files/proof-of-solo-distributor.pdf)). 
- **You need at least 2 quotations for purchase below HKD 50,000**
- You need at least 5 quotations for purchase above HKD 50,000 (not recommended)
- For **consumables** (reagents, chemicals, **customed compound synthesis**...):
  - Same item(s) and same amount in quotation A and quotation B;
  - Each item in quotation A must be cheaper than that in quotation B;
  - For chemicals, download their SDS and [check whether they are Dangerous Goods](/dangerous-goods.html);
- For **services** (PK analysis conducted by CRO...):
  - Service contract from the chosen supplier;
  - Carefully examine the confidentiality and payment terms;
  - Seek approval from Professor Micky by email (attach service contract);
  - Forward Professor Micky's approval email to Martin;

## Upload to KingDee (by Martin)

1. Martin checks the OneDrive folder every other day.
2. If the supplier is not yet registered in the KingDee system, you need to ask the supplier to:
   - Complete this supplier registration form: [中文版](/files/supplier-registration-form-(chi).pdf) / [English version](/files/supplier-registration-form-(eng).pdf).
   - **Stamp the registration form with their company chop**. 
   - Provide the PDF copy of their BR (business registration). 
   - Send the scanned form and supplier's BR to Martin.
3. Martin uploads the material to KingDee.

## Check Approval Status and Confirm Order

1. After upload to KingDee, a PO number like **CRMH2023-010001** will be generated.
2. You can check the status of the PO in [this Excel file (read-only)](https://cashkisi-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/martin_fung_crmh-cas_org_hk/EWpPTqU-goVKu0fkl1pR_FABWuC3BF1x_aTBMkj2YWLAGQ). 
   - Red: not yet approved
   - Yellow: approved
3. **Confirm quotation with the supplier ONLY AFTER the PO is approved!**
4. Some suppliers require stamp on the quotation. Send them to Martin.
